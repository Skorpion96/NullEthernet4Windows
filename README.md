# NullEthernet4Windows
A null driver for NullEthernet.kext from RehabMan https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Null-Ethernet to make Windows recognize the device. It's pretty obvious that this is an empty driver to make the device be recognized, it does nothing

Disable driver signature enforcement, go on Device Management, locate the unrecognized device and install the inf on this repo.
